**Note:** Vim Oh My wouldn't be complete if it wasn't for awesome prior art. So, make it stand out by pairing it with [terminal-oh-my](https://github.com/adrfer/terminal-oh-my) and [onedark.vim](https://github.com/adrfer/onedark.vim) projects which have been inspired by joshdick's [onedark.vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) and atom's great [one-dark-syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).
